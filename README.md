# Rust Book

This project is in juncture with the [Rust Programming Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## Questions

- Why does this repo exist?
    - As I go through the book, I want to physically go through some of the examples the book has as that is the best way I learn and retain information. I will use this to also add anything I find interesting that goes along with the topic the book is currently going through.
